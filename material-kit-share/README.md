# How to install
Note that this does not include the node-modules. You have to install them yourselves first before using (~roughly 500 mb).
To do so, do:
```
npm install
```

# To start
You can do:
```
npm start
```
to see the page. Note that the page (as seen in the screenshot below) can be found in the page '/Announcements'. For example, it can be in: 'localhost:3000/Announcements'.
